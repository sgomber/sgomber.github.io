I am a 2nd year CS PhD student at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/) working with [Prof. Gagandeep Singh](https://ggndpsngh.github.io/). My current research focuses on building automated program analyzers based on abstract interpretation, with the goal of making them more effective and adaptable across diverse analysis scenarios by leveraging symbolic reasoning and learning-based techniques. More broadly, I am interested in automated reasoning, including tools such as SAT and SMT solvers, and the analysis and use of neuro-symbolic systems.


Prior to starting PhD, I completed an MS in Computer Science at UIUC (2022–2024), advised by Prof. Gagandeep Singh. My thesis, [Neural Abstract Interpretation](https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/items/131524), received the [David J. Kuck Outstanding MS Thesis Award](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/about/awards/graduate-fellowships-awards/david-j-kuck-outstanding-thesis-awards). I hold a B.Tech. in Computer Science from [IIT Guwahati](https://www.iitg.ac.in/), and have previously worked at [D. E. Shaw & Co.](https://www.deshawindia.com/) (two years as an SDE) and the Automated Reasoning Group at AWS ([Zelkova team](https://www.amazon.science/blog/a-billion-smt-queries-a-day#:~:text=invited%20paper.-,Zelkova,-At%20Amazon%2C%20we), Summer 2023).
