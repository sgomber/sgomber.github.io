I am a 1st year CS PhD student at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/) working with [Prof. Gagandeep Singh](https://ggndpsngh.github.io/). My current research focuses on developing efficient and precise techniques for program analysis by leveraging the synergy between learning-based and symbolic methods. I  also have a keen interest in automated reasoning tools (such as SAT/SMT solvers), and the analysis of neuro-symbolic systems.

Prior to starting my PhD, I obtained my MS CS degree from UIUC (2022-2024), where I was advised by Prof. Gagandeep Singh (Thesis: [Neural Abstract Interpretation](https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/items/131524)). Before my MS, I graduated with a B. Tech. degree in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.iitg.ac.in/">IIT Guwahati</a> in May 2020. After that, I worked as a software engineer (SDE-2) in the Trading Systems team at <a href="https://www.deshawindia.com/">D. E. Shaw & Co.</a> for two years. I was also as an Applied Science Intern (Summer 2023) with the Automated Reasoning Group @ AWS ([Zelkova team](https://www.amazon.science/blog/a-billion-smt-queries-a-day#:~:text=invited%20paper.-,Zelkova,-At%20Amazon%2C%20we)).
